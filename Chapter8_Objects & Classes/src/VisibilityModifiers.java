//Files with a class extension are aggregated into packages or collections of related class files.
//Every class in java belongs to a package. 
//if there is no package created before, then all the source code were placed in the current directory (default package)

//syntax:
// package packageName; 
//(must be the first statement in the source code)

// accessibility of a class, data members  and member methods can be arranged as Class scope  , member scope 

//CLASS SCOPE
//scope arranges the accessibility or visibility of a program constructs such as classes and their members

//class scope can be arranged as ;public scope, package scope

//package scope for classes 
//A class with package scope is visible ONLY inside its containing package.

//Example:
//package Sample;
//class Department {}
//class Employee {

	//Department d = new Department()

//}



//Example:
//package Sample;
//class Department {}
//class Employee {

	//Department d = new Department()

//}

//Public scope for classes 
// A class with public scope is visible outside its containing package 





public class VisibilityModifiers {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub

	}

}
